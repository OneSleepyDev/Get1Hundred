# Get1Hundred
A simple collect game made using Phaser

Intended to be used on a tablet or phone, but playable in any browser that supports HTML5

# Play the game
http://onesleepydev.github.io/Get1Hundred/

Move around the small area and try to collect 100 before the timer runs out.
* If you're on a phone, you can swipe the direction you want to go in: Left, Right, Up, Up Left, Up Right
* If you're on a desktop/laptop, you can swipe, or use the arrow keys: Left, Right, Up, Up and Left together, Up and Right together

(It's simpler than it sounds, promise!)
